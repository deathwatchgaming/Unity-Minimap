Description:

 The "MiniMap" needs some sort of "characterController" to work, thus one would not be able to test such 
 if they do not already have one to test stufff with. As such provided here is just a simple 
 "testercontroller" for testing stuff if the end-user needs such and does not already have something.

 Simple manual setup details can be found in the related DIR: "Info" via: "TestStuff_ReadMe.txt"
